### A new and improved way to solve online interview scams

Our proposed solution uses an innovative machine-learning Approach to solve this new-age problem.
<be>
Some stand-out features of our prototype
- Real-time face detection
- Real-time face recognition
- Real-time eye & lip tracking
- real-time voice analysis

  *Our solution is a proposed method to solve the problem of online interview scams- ***But it is not a policing app****

### Workflow
1. Congratulations on being selected for the interview round
2. tentatively a week before the interview the candidate is required to send a video (no lag, no delay, clear face and voice) reading some provided lines.
2.1. from this video we take video, audio, eye-tracking, and lip-tracking data
2.2. the candidate is then graded on these parameters
3. On the interview day, the candidate will sign in and meet with the interviewer in the portal.
3.1. The interviewee side will have the authentications(face recognition, eye tracking, voice detection, lip tracking)  done regularly at intervals of time (except the first check will happen in the first 1-2 mins.)
3.2. The interviewer will be provided with a score after each check.
3.3. feedback will be reverted back to the candidate
